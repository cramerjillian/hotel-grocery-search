## About the Project

Hotel-Grocery Search is a single-page application meant to support travel planning and fills a gap in Google Maps' current capabilities.

Users may enter any U.S. city and a distance to find hotels within their preferred distance of a grocery store in that city. Using Google APIs and libraries, this tool provides a new service in that Google Maps does not currently support proximity-based searches of two different types of establishments.
