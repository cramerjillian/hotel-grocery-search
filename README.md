# Hotel-Grocery Search

## About the Project

Hotel-Grocery Search is a single-page application meant to support travel planning.

Users may enter any U.S. city and a distance to find hotels within their preferred distance of a grocery store in that city. Using Google APIs and libraries, this tool provides a new service in that Google Maps does not currently support proximity-based searches of two different types of establishments in one query.

## User Instructions

* Enter a valid U.S. city and state (abbreviated).
* Enter a distance (in miles), representing the maximum distance between a hotel and grocery store in the results.
* Click the "Submit" button to perform the search.
* Use the interactable map and search results table to view hotel-grocery store pairs that are within the your preferred distance.
  * Clicking on a row within the results table will bring up a zoomed-in map of that single hotel-grocery store result.

## Tools Used

**Frontend:**

* HTML5
* CSS6
* JavaScript ES6

**Backend:**

* Node.js server served by Express.js framework
  * Used to prevent the Google API key from being publicly accessible on Github

**Google APIs:**

* Google Geocoding API
  * Converts the user input city, state data into geographical coordinates
* Google Maps Javascript API
  * Generates an interactable Google Maps map on the webpage centered at the given city
* Google Places API
  * Performs an establishment-type search within the bounds of the given city

## Installation Instructions

1) Clone the Github repository.
3) Install Node at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en), if not already installed.
2) Open VSCode (or preferred IDE) and navigate to the project directory.
4) Install node dependences
```bash
npm install
```
5) Create an .env file. cp .env.example .env
```bash
cp env.example .env
```
6) Open the new .env file and paste the provided Google API key where instructed.
7) Run the server (npm run dev)
```bash
npm run dev
```
Confirm that the server is running at localhost:8080.
8) Open localhost:8080 to view the homepage
